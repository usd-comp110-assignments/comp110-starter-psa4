    Decreases the volume of a sound object by a specified factor.

    Paramters:
    original_sound (type; Sound): The sound object whose volume is to be decreased.
    factor (type: float): The factor by which the volume is to be decreased.

    Returns:
    (type: Sound) A new sound object that is a copy of original_sound, but with volumes
    scaled by factor.

    Mixes together two sounds (snd1 and snd2) into a single sound.
    If the sounds are of different length, the mixed sound will be the length
    of the longer sound.

    sounds.

    Parameters:
    snd1 (type: Sound) - The first sound to mix
    snd2 (type: Sound) - The second sound to mix

    Returns:
    (type: Sound) A Sound object that combines the two parameter sounds into a
    single, overlapping sound.
